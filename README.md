# ES6-Generators

Following the [four-part tutorial](https://davidwalsh.name/es6-generators) by Kyle Simpson on ES6 Generators.
  
Article was written in 2014 but still serves as a nice intro to generators and gives some sample uses.

1. Basics
2. Diving Deeper
3. Going Async
4. Getting Concurrent (skipping for now, will return to if I find some urgent need for concurrency as the links take a deep-dive into some pretty esoteric stuff)
